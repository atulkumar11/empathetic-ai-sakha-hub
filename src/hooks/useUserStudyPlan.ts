    title: "Newton's Second Law of Motion",
    subject: "Physics",
    chapter: "Laws of Motion",
    difficulty: "Medium",
    content: "Newton's second law of motion states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting upon it and inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically, it is expressed as F = ma, where F is the net force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration. This law forms the foundation of classical mechanics and is extensively used in solving problems involving forces and motion. When multiple forces act on an object, we can find the net force by vector addition of all individual forces.",

    examRelevance: "This concept appears in 30-40% of JEE mechanics problems. Questions often involve calculating acceleration, force, or mass when the other two quantities are given. Multiple-choice questions may require identifying scenarios where the law applies correctly.",
    examples: [
      "A car accelerating on a straight road demonstrates Newton's Second Law - the engine applies force, causing acceleration proportional to the car's mass.",
      "When you push a shopping cart, the acceleration you create depends on both how hard you push and the mass of items in the cart.",
      "A rocket launching into space accelerates as the engines exert force, with the acceleration determined by the ratio of thrust to the rocket's mass."

    difficulty: "Hard",
    content: "Circular motion is the movement of an object along a circular path. In uniform circular motion, an object moves at a constant speed along a circular path. The direction of motion changes continuously, which means there is acceleration, called centripetal acceleration. This acceleration is directed toward the center of the circle. The centripetal force is the force that makes an object follow a curved path, and it's always pointed toward the center of rotation.",

    examRelevance: "Circular motion problems appear in about 15-20% of JEE Physics questions. They often integrate concepts of Newton's laws with rotational dynamics. Expect questions on centripetal forces, angular velocity, and problems involving banked curves or conical pendulums.",

    content: "The law of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of an isolated system remains constant if no external forces act on the system. Momentum is defined as the product of mass and velocity. In collisions, momentum is always conserved, whether the collision is elastic or inelastic. In an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved, while in an inelastic collision, only momentum is conserved.",
