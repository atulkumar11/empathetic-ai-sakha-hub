          <h4 className="font-medium text-violet-700">First Law of Motion (Law of Inertia)</h4>
          <p>Newton's First Law states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. This law is often referred to as the law of inertia, where inertia is the resistance of any physical object to any change in its velocity.</p>
          <p>Examples include:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>A book resting on a table remains at rest until a force (like your hand) moves it.</li>
            <li>Passengers in a moving car tend to continue moving forward when the car suddenly stops.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4 className="font-medium text-violet-700 mt-4">Second Law of Motion (F=ma)</h4>
          <p>Newton's Second Law quantifies the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration. It states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of that object multiplied by its acceleration.</p>
          <p className="font-mono bg-gray-50 p-2 rounded">F = ma</p>
          <p>Where:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>F is the net force applied (measured in Newtons)</li>
            <li>m is the mass of the object (measured in kilograms)</li>
            <li>a is the acceleration (measured in meters per second squared)</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4 className="font-medium text-violet-700 mt-4">Third Law of Motion (Action-Reaction)</h4>
          <p>Newton's Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When one object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts a force equal in magnitude but opposite in direction back on the first object.</p>
          <p>Examples include:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>A swimmer pushing water backward (action) propels themselves forward (reaction).</li>
            <li>A rocket expelling gas downward (action) propels the rocket upward (reaction).</li>
